This template allows you to keep custom rules in your list, to sync between browsers. Just write them as you would in the `My filters` page of uBlock settings.

Of couse, if you think a filter would be useful to others, don't hesitate to [suggest it as a new filter](https://github.com/xvello/letsblockit/issues)!
