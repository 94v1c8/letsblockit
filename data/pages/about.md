## About: Let's block it!

[uBlock Origin](https://ublockorigin.com/fr) is a great browser extension to filter out ads, trackers and annoyances. Thanks to
list maintainers like [EasyList](https://easylist.to/) and [AdGuard](https://kb.adguard.com/en/general/adguard-ad-filters),
we enjoy daily updates to these high-quality filters.

To address the bane of online advertising, the ad blocker projects developed advanced rule engines that we can leverage
to block  other types of low-value content, such as [search results](https://letsblock.it/filters/search-results) or
[youtube videos](https://letsblock.it/filters/tag/youtube).
The goal of this project is to make it easy to share and use customizable filters to hide unwanted content from the
websites we visit.

While the definition of ads, trackers and annoyances is pretty clear and un-ambiguous, it is harder to define what
low-value content is. Instead of a fixed common list, we are taking the approach of customizable filters that you
configure for your tastes.

## What's currently available?

The first phase of this project is to compile a collection of [customizable filters](https://letsblock.it/filters/),
that enables you to create  custom rules for your own use. You'll have to manually add them to your uBlock settings
(in the `My filters` section).

If you have low-value content filters you'd like to contribute, please
[open an issue](https://github.com/xvello/letsblockit/issues) so that we can add it to the list! Please note that
blocking ads and trackers is explicitly out of the scope of this project, they are better suited in
[EasyList](https://easylist.to/) for example.

## What's coming up?

After finding quality filters, the other pain point we identified is syncing them between devices. While uBlock Origin
integrates with the browser's profile sync system, this is not optimal for many of us.

We want to allow everyone to register, create a list of filters, and use it on all of their devices, like they would
with Easylist.
