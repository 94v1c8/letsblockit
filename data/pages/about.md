## About the weBlock project

[uBlock](https://ublockorigin.com/fr) is a great browser extension to block ads, trackers and annoyances. Thanks to list maintainers like [EasyList](https://easylist.to/) and [AdGuard](https://kb.adguard.com/en/general/adguard-ad-filters), we enjoy daily updates to these filters. But you can go further!

The goal of this project is to help you leverage the power of uBlock's filtering engine to tailor your web experience. You can create custom rules to hide [search results](/filters/search-results) or [youtube videos](/filters/tag/youtube) for example.
